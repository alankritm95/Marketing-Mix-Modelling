# Marketing-Mix-Modelling

There is science behind advertising investment, and this science is called "Marketing Mix Modeling" (MMM).

It is a Marketing Analytics Framework that relies on the application of advanced statistical methods (econometrics) on historical data to understand the impact of each individual sales driver, measure ROI and predict future performance.

I worked on a samll data set to implement Marketing Mix Modeling using Excel to show case how it is an essential tool for data-driven decision making. 

Utilized linear regression for prediction, employed solver for optimization, and fine-tuning parameters to increase the efficiency of the model.
